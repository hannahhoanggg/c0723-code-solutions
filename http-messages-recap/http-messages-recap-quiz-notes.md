## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a client?
  A client is a software application that initiates a request to a server in order to retrieve web resources. The client sends an HTTP request to a server, which processes the request & sends back an HTTP response containing the requested resource.
- What is a server?
  A server is a specialized computer or software system that provides services, resources or data to other computers/clients. They are designed to handle requests from clients & fulfill those requests by performing specific tasks or delivering requested content.
- Which HTTP method does a browser issue to a web server when you visit a URL?
  When you visit a URL in a web browser, the browser typically issues an HTTP GET request to the web server. It is used to request a specific resource from server.
- What is on the first line of an HTTP **request** message?
  The first line of an HTTP "request" message is the HTTP method (that is being used for the request).
- What is on the first line of an HTTP **response** message?
  The first line of an HTTP "response" message is the HTTP version of the HTTP protocol that the server is using to send the response.
- What are HTTP headers?
  HTTP headers are information that are both in an HTTP request & response messages exchanged between a client & a server. They provide additional metadata about the request/response & play a crucial role in controlling & describing the communication between client & server.
- Is a body required for a valid HTTP message?
  No, a body is not required for a valid HTTP message & it depends on the specific HTTP request/response & its associated HTTP method & headers.

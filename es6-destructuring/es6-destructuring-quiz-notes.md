## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is destructuring, conceptually?
  Destructuring is a concept (in programming) that allows you to extract elements/properties from complex data structures like arrays/objects & assign them to individual variables in convenient way.
  It's a technique that simiplifies the process of accessing & using specific components of a larger data structure.
- What is the syntax for `Object` destructuring?
  The syntax for "object destructuring" is having curly braces on left side of assignment with properties inside the curly braces that you want to extract from the "object". The identifier before the colon is the property of an object & the identifier after the colon is the variable.
  -const { property1, property2 } = object;

- What is the syntax for `Array` destructuring?
  The syntax for "array destructuring" is having square brackets on left side of assignment with elements inside the brackets that are variables with assigned values from the array.
  -const [element1, element2] = array;
- How can you tell the difference between destructuring and creating `Object`/`Array` literals?
  Destructuring breaks down existing data structures for easier access to contents whereas creating object/array literals defines new arrays/objects with specific values/properties.

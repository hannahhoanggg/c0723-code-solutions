## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What method is available in the `node:fs` module for writing data to a file?
  In the 'node:fs' module, you can use the 'writeFile' method to write data to a file. It is used to asynchronously write data to a file, creating the file if it does not exist or overwriting its contents if it does.
- Are file operations using the `fs` module synchronous or asynchronous?
  File operations using the 'fs' module can be both synchronous & asynchronous, depending on the method you choose. It is recommended to use asynchronous file operations in node.js because they are non-blocking & allow your application to remain responsive.

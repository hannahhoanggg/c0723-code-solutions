## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  A function is a building block of JavaScript that allows the code to be called many times without repetition.
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  A function defintion consists of the function keyword followed by the name of the function, list of parameters enclosed in parentheses & separated by commas, the statements that define the function and enclosed in curly braces. It names the function and specifies what to do when the function is called.
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  We write the name of the function and placing parentheses next to it and arguments inside the parentheses. It causes the code block within the function's definition to be executed. Calling the function performs the specified actions with the indicated parameters.
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  When you call a function, you write the name of the function with parentheses and it runs the code inside the function whereas defining the definition does not run the code and defines the name. Function defintion has parameters while the function call has arguments.
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  A parameter is a placeholder where the variable whose value is not known until we call the function and pass the argument. Arguments are values passed to the function when called.
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  Parameters determine the number of times when the function will run. It helps define the boundaries of the problem. It allows us to pass data into a function so we can reference it.
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  The "return" statement causes the function to produce a value we can use in the program and it prevents any more code in the function's code block from being run. Stops the execution of code.

## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- Give 6 examples of comparison operators.
  Some examples of comparison operators are <, >, >=, <=, double equality sign (==), and != (not equal).
- What data type do comparison expressions evaluate to?
  All comparison expressions evaluate to a boolean value.
- What is the purpose of an `if` statement?
  The purpose of an "if" statement is a condition statement that guides the program on whether or not a block of code should run or shouldn't run and it allows us to make decisions if the conditions are true or false.
- Is `else` required in order to use an `if` statement?
  No, else is not required in order to use an if statement because it is optional. It's not always required.
- Describe the syntax (structure) of an `if` statement.
  You have the "if" keyword with the if statement, then parentheses for the conditional statement with conditional expression inside it, opening curly braces where we put the code inside, and if we need an else statement that we want to run.
- What are the three logical operators?
  The three logical operators are or, and, not.
- How do you compare two different expressions in the same condition?
  We can compare 2 different expressions in the same condition by using the logical and operators.
- What is the purpose of a `switch` statement?
  The purpose of a switch statement matches the expressions against of clause cases. It's a cleaner way to write statements for a group of conditions to check and evaluate.
- Is a `default` clause required in order to use a `switch` statement?
  No, a default clause is not required in order to use a switch statement, and it's optional.

  The object that is built into the browser for making HTTP requests in JavaScript is the XMLHttpRequest object.
- What event is fired by `XMLHttpRequest` objects when they are finished loading the data from the server?
  The event that is fired by the XMLHttpRequest objects when they are finished loading the data from the server is the load event.

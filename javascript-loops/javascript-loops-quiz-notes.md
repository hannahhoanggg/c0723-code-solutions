## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of a loop?
  The purpose of a loop is to execute a group of instructions or a block of code multiple times without writing it repeatedly.
- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
  The purpose of the condition expression in a loop is to be tested each time the loop repeats. As long as the condition is true, the loop keeps running.
- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
  Iteration (in the context of loops) means that the computer runs each repetition code through a loop to meet the condition.
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
  The condition expression of a "While" loop gets evaluated before executing the statment.
- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The initialization expression of a "for" loop gets evaluated once at the beginning of the loop.
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The condition expression of a "for" loop is evaluated each time the loop repeats.
- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The final expression of a "for" loop gets evaluated at the end of each loop iteration.
- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
  The keyword that exits a loop before its condition expression evaluates to false is break.
- What does the `++` increment operator do?
  The ++ increment operator increments (adds one to) its operand and returns the value before or after the increment.
- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?
  You iterate through an object key by using the for in loop.

- What is SQL and how is it different from languages like JavaScript?
  SQL (Structured Query Language) is the primary way of interacting with relational databases. It is a powerful way of retrieving, creating, & manipulating data in relational database. SQL is different because it is a declarative programming language so you describe the results you want & the programming environment comes up with its own plan for getting those results.

  To retrieve specific columns from a database table, you can use SQL queries with the syntax "SELECT, FROM, WHERE."
- How do you filter rows based on some specific criteria?
  You can filter rows based on specific criteria in a database table by using the "WHERE" clause in your SQL query. The WHERE clause allows you to specify conditions that determine which rows are included in query result.
- What are the benefits of formatting your SQL?
  The benefits of formatting your SQL can improve code readability, maintainabilty & collaboration when working with databases.
- What are four comparison operators that can be used in a `where` clause?
  The four comparison operators in the WHERE clause are equal to, not equal to, greater than & less than, & greater than or equal to & less than or equal to.
- How do you limit the number of rows returned in a result set?
  To limit the number of rows returned in a result set, you can use the LIMIT clause. It allows you to specify the maximum number of rows to retrieve from a query.
- How do you retrieve all columns from a database table?
  To retrieve all columns from a database table in SQL, you can use the SELECT asterisk statement. The asterisk is a wildcard that represents all columns in specified table.
- How do you control the sort order of a result set?
